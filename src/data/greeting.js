  // PHILOSOPHY — engineering mindset signal
  philosophy:
    "LLMs are powerful but unreliable components. Every system I build treats model outputs as unverified signals — wrapped in validation layers, evaluation loops, and structured guardrails to deliver trustworthy results at enterprise scale.",
